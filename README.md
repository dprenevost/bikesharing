# Summary: Overall, with the data we collected, this program seemed to be well adpoted by the NYC residents. 
However, trying to adapt this for a city in Iowa would be challenging.
As you can see from the following 2 maps, NYC has a much higher population density and the average trips are quite low in duration.  Having a city that has a much wider area and on average a longer trip time may not be able to support this type of success with the CitiBike model.  This will also add many more factors in cost increase and maintenance issues.
